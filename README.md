Are you new to Star Wars ? do you want to be informed on the characters and movies they played in ?
I have the app for you.

LINK : https://force-awakened.vercel.app/

If you want to run it locally on your machine: 

- clone repository : "https://github.com/RomeoAtoyan/force-awakened.git"
- type cd "force-awakened" to open the project.
- install node modules by running "npm install" or "npm i" for shorter syntax.
- "npm start" when node modules have finished installing.

project should run on localhost:3000
- project can also be viewed locally on any mobile phone to see live changes. by going to this url : ip_adress:3000 (your own ip adress and the port the project is running on)

Now you can run the project locally on your machine and/or phone.
